All notable changes to Shipyard plugins are documented in this file.
The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `keel`, the first Shipyard plugin: a rule engine that models a project's
  git lifecycle as `(action, base, head, headIsFork, capability)`, with
  no notion of "role."
- An advisory `PreToolUse` hook that evaluates `git`/`gh` commands against
  the rule engine and warns or blocks before the command runs.
- A `SessionStart` orientation that reports topology, protected branches,
  review policy, and current branch, once per session.
- Ten lifecycle skills: `start-work`, `sync`, `finish-work`,
  `respond-to-review`, `review`, `land`, `release`, `ship`, `protect`,
  and `doctor`.
- `.keel.json` project configuration, with `trunk` and `gitflow`
  topologies, configurable branch prefixes, contribution model, review
  policy, merge strategy, and changelog requirement.
- A test suite covering the rule engine, both I/O modules, and the guard.
